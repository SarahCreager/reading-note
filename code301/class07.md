# REST

## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

This article discusses 2 behaviors that all good teams had in common.

1). everyone had the opportunity to speak about the same amount.

2). members of the team had a high level of social sensitivity.

In pair programming, it's important to have psychological safety. This means that all members feel safe to be themselves, to contribute ideas, to speak up, to make mistakes, without fearing that they will be judged or criticized.

People truly want to be themselves at work. When you create an environment that is psychologically safe, it allows this to be possible.

## How I explained REST to my brother

### Who is Roy Fielding?
He wrote some of the first web servers and conducted research on how the web works. His is mentioned on the protocol that is used to display pages to your browser.

### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
Machines weren't designed for this. When the web was first being developed, the ability to talk to any machine was a concern. However, most of the later developers didn't have that requirement. They created machines with the ability to simply talk to a small group of machines.

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
The protocol Fielding and his colleges created applies verbs to nouns.

 "For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page."


### What does a GET do?
GET is how systems retrieve information from one another.

### What does a POST do?
POST allows a system to add something to another system.

### What does PUT do?
PUT allows a system to replace something in another system. 

### What does PATCH do?
PATCH allows a system wants to do a partial update.
