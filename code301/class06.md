## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
*This information below was copied from [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)*

1). Greater efficiency

2). Engaged collaboration

3). Learning from fellow students

4). Social skills

5). Job interview readiness

6). Work environment readiness

### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
I have found greater efficiency to be the most beneficial aspect. Sometimes just talking through a code problem with your partner can help you solve it far quicker than if you had been on your own. It can be the difference of spending 20 minutes talking something through verses hours of time on your own.
