# Forms and JS Events
## Form Controls

* Add text
* Make decisions
* Submit

## How forms work

1). User inputs data and presses a button that submits the information

2). The name of the form and the data is sent to the server

3). The server analyzes the information, sometimes also stores in a database

4). The server creates a page to send the user to (for example: thank you page, your entry was submitted)

Forms use **name/value** pairs. 

The `<form> ` element should always have an action attribute. The **action attribute** is a URL for the page receiving information from the submitted form. 

## Lists, Tables & Forms
CSS allows you to customize the design of lists, tables, and forms. 

`list-style-type` allows you to change the style of lists (decimal, lower-roman, disc)

`list-style-position` allows you to move the marker in relation to the list. (outside, inside)

## Events

**Events** trigger a function in JavaScript when they are *fired* or *raised*. Some examples are: click, submit, error, scroll)

**Event Handlers** can be used to designate when code should be executed in response to an event, like when the user clicks a button.
