# Event Driven Applications

## Review, Research, and Discussion

**Why is access control important?**

Access controls limits access based on authorization, which helps regulate who is using a given resource.  

**Describe an application that would need access control.**

A bank application would need access control so that only the holder of an account can access and edit its sensitive information.  

**What is a role used for?**

A role is a set of access rights to an application that a user has.  

**Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?**

Role-based access control allows a system admin to assign rights based on the individual's role in the organization, rather than setting access specifications for each individual which would be hard to scale.
