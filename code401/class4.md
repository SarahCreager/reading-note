# Data Modeling

**Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development**

1). reduction in defect rates with a moderate increase in development effort

2). reduced effort in the final phases of a project

3). improved design and higher degree of technical quality


**In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?**

If you have functionality that needs to repeat for multiple tests, it would be beneficial to use `beforeEach()` and `afterEach()`.

**What is one downside of Test Driven Development**

Some downsides include forgetting to run your tests, having a test suite that isn't maintained with your code, or working on a team that only partially uses TDD. 


**Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?**

ES6 classes can accomplish the same thing as constructor classes, but it can be done using easier and cleaner syntax. 

**Why REST?**

REST allows clients to access database operations in a consistent way. It is flexible, avoids ambiguity, is highly scalable. 


## Vocabulary Terms

| Term      | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| functional programming      | creating software with pure functions that avoid shared state, mutable data, and side-effects   |
| object-oriented programming (OOP)   | creates software design around data/objects, instead of functions and logic        |
| class      | a template for creating objects, providing a blueprint that includes properties and the methods that all objects of a certain kind share in common     |
| super   | refers to the parent class constructor       |
| this   | the term used when an object refers to it's own properties and behaviors         |
| Test Driven Development (TDD)     | process where coding and testing are closely connected      |
| Jest  | JavaScript Testing Framework where you can create, run, and structure tests      |
| Continuous Integration (CI)   | the process of integrating code into a shared repository frequently and consistently during development        |
| REST     | Representational state transfer an architectural guide for development  |
| Data Model  | a visual representation of how information communicates and connects between data points and structures       |

**Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?**

1). REST

2). TDD

3). CI

**Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?**

1). Integrating SQL Database in a restful way with our server

2). Constructing middleware

3). Building helpful and precise tests using JEST


**What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?**

1) I'm excited to refactor my routing and implement data modeling.
