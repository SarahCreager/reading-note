# AWS: Events

## Review, Research, and Discussion

**Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server**

Both have the ability to test and run RESTFUL CRUD operations. 

**List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each**

"If you need very defined structure to your data storage you may want to consider something like AWS RDS, MySQL, or Postgres. If not, NoSQL systems like AWS DynamoDB, and MongoDB are generally faster to develop on as they forego much of these structure requirements"

[Amazon Web Services (AWS) database](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-and-pros-and-cons-between-Amazon-Web-Services-AWS-database-tool-AWS-RDS-and-AWS-DynamoDB)

**What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?**

"FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing and ensure that the order in which messages are sent and received is strictly preserved."

**How can the server be assured a message was properly received?**

You can use SQS to ensure your message is delivered.
