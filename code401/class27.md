# useState() Hook

## Review, Research, and Discussion

**How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?**

React is a UI library that breaks things down into components and uses JSX to combine JS and HTML. 

**What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?**

"A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function which accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. A class component requires you to extend from React.Component and create a render function which returns a React element. This requires more code but will also give you some benefits which you will see later on."
