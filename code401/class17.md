# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

**Describe “The Cloud”**

"The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers."

[What is the cloud? | Cloud definition](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-the-cloud/)

**What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?**

"Put simply, a container consists of an entire runtime environment: an application, plus all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries, and configuration files needed to run it, bundled into one package."

[What are containers and why do you need them?](https://www.cio.com/article/2924995/what-are-containers-and-why-do-you-need-them.html)

**What is auto-scaling?**

Auto-scaling is the process of monitoring applications and adjusting the capacity needed to maintain steady, predictable performance. 

[AWS Docs](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/);

**What is bandwidth?**

"bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path."

[Bandwidth Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing))

**How do cloud providers compute service costs?**

Cloud providers determine how much it will cost them to maintain the network. Some categories they consider are network hardware costs, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor costs.
