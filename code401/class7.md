# Bearer Authorization

## Review, Research, and Discussion

**Write the following steps in the correct order:**

1). Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret  
2). Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party  
3). Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint  
4). Receive authorization code  
5). Make a request to the access token endpoint  
6). Receive access token  
7). Make a request to a third-party API endpoint  

**What can you do with an authorization code?**

Authorization code is temporary code that the client exchanges for an access token.

**What can you do with an access token?**

"Access tokens are used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access an API. The application receives an access token after a user successfully authenticates and authorizes access, then passes the access token as a credential when it calls the target API" - Auth0 Docs

**Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?**

0Auth is more secure and the user does not have to provide a password.

## Vocabulary Terms

| Term      | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Client ID     | "the client application that will be requesting resources from the Resource Server."  |
| Client Secret   | "only known to your application and the authorization server"      |
| Authentication Endpoint      | only allows authorized devices to connect    |
| Access Token Endpoint   | where the apps makes a request for the access token from a user     |
| API Endpoint   | "a point at which an API -- the code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other -- connects with the software program"      |
| Authorization Code   | "The authorization code is a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token."     |
| Access Token   | "an access token contains the security credentials for a login session and identifies the user, the user's groups, the user's privileges, and, in some cases, a particular application"      |

## Preview

**Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?**

1). JWT

2). Authorization Headers

3). Authentication

**Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?**

1). How to write code that properly using JWT

2). How the flow of information works in the JWT process

3). How to create our own authentication system in it's entirety

**What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?**

I'm excited to implement JWT today. We did this briefly in 301, but we rushed through it so quickly, I still don't completely understand the steps involved.
