# Bearer Authorization

## Review, Research, and Discussion

**Write the following steps in the correct order:**

Receive access token
Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
Receive authorization code
Make a request to the access token endpoint


**What can you do with an authorization code?**

**What can you do with an access token?**

**Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?**

## Preview

**Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?**

1). JWT

2). Authorization Headers

3). Authentication

**Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?**

1). How to write code that properly using JWT

2). How the flow of information works in the JWT process

3). How to create our own authentication system in it's entirety

**What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?**

I'm excited to implement JWT today. We did this briefly in 301, but we rushed through it so quickly, I still don't completely understand the steps involved.
