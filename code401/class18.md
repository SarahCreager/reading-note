# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

**What are serverless functions?**

A single-purpose function that is hosted on the cloud.

**If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?**

I would write functions on VS code and then upload the zipped file to a serverless system on AWS.  

**Describe how a CDN works**

"A CDN is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device."
