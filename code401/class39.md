# Redux - Additional Topics

## Review, Research, and Discussion

**What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?**

Fire off the async action to fetch from database on useEffect when the component mounts. 

**When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?**

You export the function.
