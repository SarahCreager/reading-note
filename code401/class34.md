## Review, Research, and Discussion

**How do bearer tokens work?**

"The Bearer Token is created for you by the Authentication server. When a user authenticates your application (client) the authentication server then goes and generates for you a Token. Bearer Tokens are the predominant type of access token used with OAuth 2.0. A Bearer token basically says “Give the bearer of this token access”."
