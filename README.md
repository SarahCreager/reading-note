# **A Little About Me**

*Welcome to my Code Fellows reading notes! I am a former ICU nurse who is changing careers to pursue my passion for coding. I am also a musician. I love how coding and music correlate. You take something that looks like a bunch of shapes on a page and bring it to life through music. The same process occurs with coding. You translate a language of text and symbols into something visual and unique. It's quite remarkable and Iâ€™m very excited to learn and grow in this field.
