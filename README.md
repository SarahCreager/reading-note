# Welcome to Sarah's Reading Notes!

## A Little About Me

*Welcome to my Code Fellows reading notes! My name is Sarah. I am a former ICU nurse and musician changing careers to pursue my passion for software development. The thing I love most about coding is that it allows you to integrate analytical thinking with creativity and it’s a subject that I’m constantly challenged and intrigued by.
