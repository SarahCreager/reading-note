## Images

* You can adjust the size of your image using `height` and `width` properties. 

* It's best to come up with a standard size across your website for small medium and large images, then give them the class name 'small', 'medium' or 'large' and use this to style them.

* Images are inline elements by default. One way to center an image without flex is:

```css
img{
  display: block;
  text-align: center;
  margin: auto;
}
```

* You can specify class names for images that are to be centered in the same way. 

* A great tip if something isn't centering:  make sure you are in the container element and if you are using flex, make sure you know which way your main axis is going. You can also use the inspect tool and see if there is any unusual padding or margins. 

* The `background-image` property allows you to put an image behind an element. 

* You can repeat this image with `background-repeat: repeat-x` (repeat horizontally), `background-repeat: repeat-y` (repeat vertically). 

* `background-attachment: scroll` allows the image to scroll as you move down the page. 

* You can adjust the position of the background image with `background-position`
