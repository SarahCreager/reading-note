# Objects and the DOM
## What is an Object?
An `object` groups together variables and functions to create a model. In an object *variables* are called `properties` and *functions* are called `methods`. These `properties` and `methods` are **key/value** pairs. 

You can access properties and methods from within an object with dot notation or square brackets. 

```
car.name;
```
```
car['name'];
```
## DOM
The `Document Object Model` is a tree-like structure that represents the webpage to browsers. The tree contains HTML elements called `nodes`.

**4 Types of DOM Nodes** 

* document nodes

* element nodes

* attribute nodes

* text nodes

You can access specific elements or groups of elements within the DOM and perform certain tasks like updating or deleting values. 

```
getElementById('carOne');
```
This tells the browser to look through the DOM to find an element with the Id attribute `carOne`.
