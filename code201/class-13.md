# Local Storage

## Cookies
 * cookies were invented as a way to provide local storage for web applications. 

* The downside to cookies is that they slow the web page down, they send unencrypted data, and they can only store around 4 KB of data. 

## HTML5 
* Many single browsers or third-party plugins tried to create something  that could hold more storage, persist after refresh and not transmit data to the server, but they all had drawbacks. 

* Then, HTML5 was invented. It stores information in key/value pairs locally in the web browser. The data persists after the user navigates away. The information is never transmitted to remote web servers. You don't need a third-party plugin to use or a specific web browser.

* In the key/value pairs in HTML5, data is stored as strings. If you need to use the data as a number, you will need to convert the data when you access it.
