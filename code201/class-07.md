# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## DOM
The highest object in the DOM is the object called `document`. 

| Property | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| document.write () | writes a string of text in the document |
| document.getElementById () | returns an element with the value of the ID |
| document.createElement () | creates an element |

## Object Constructor Notation
You can  use the `new` keyword and `object constructor` to create an object. After creating the object, you can add properties and methods. 

```javascript
var car =  new Object();
```
To update the value  of properties in an object use:

```javascript
car.name = 'Toyota':
````

**OR**

```javascript
car['name'] = 'Toyota':
````

## Arrays and Objects

* Arrays are a type of object using index as the key in their key/value pairs. 

* Objects can contain arrays and arrays can contain objects. 



## Tables

`<table>` creates a table 

`<tr>` creates a table row

`<td>` creates table data

`<th>` creates table heading



You can use `<thead>` `<tbody>` and `<tfoot>` for longer tables. 

`<td colspan="3">` allows your table data to span 3 columns. 

`<td rowspan="4">` allows you to span 4 rows.
