# Images, Color, Text

## Images

* You can add an image into HTML using the `<img>` element. 
* You must add a `src` attribute to your image to indicate the source. 
* It's good practice to save the image in the same size you'll be using on your site. 

### 3 rules for images

1) right format

2) right size

3) right pixels

**JPEG** use this for images that have variation in color.

**PNG** use this for images with text, transparency, or sharp contrast (logos)

**GIF** use this for images with animation.

## Color

You can select color in CSS in 4 different ways.

1) RGB

2) Hex codes

3) color name (predefined names in CSS)

4) HSL (hue, sat, lightness)

## Designing Text


`font-family` allows you to select the name of the font. 

`text-transform` allows you to change the case to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize

`text-align` allows you to move text left right center or justify

`:link` allows you to set the style for links that have not been clicked

`:visited` allows you to set style for links that have been visited 

`:hover` when a user hovers over the element, it can change 

*If you are using multiple font formats, they should appear in code in the following order:*

1) eot
2) woff
3) ttf/otf
4) svg
