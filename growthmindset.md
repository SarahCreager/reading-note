# **What is a Growth Mindset?**

Growth mindset is the ability to grow, evolve and learn. It’s an eagerness to try new things, to face obstacles that come your way, and to learn from your failures. A person with a growth mindset embraces challenges, persists despite hitting obstacles, grows from criticism, and finds inspiration from other’s success.

### 3 Reminders to Maintain a Growth Mindset:
```
1. Instead of viewing the success of others as a threat, use it as inspiration
2. Take criticism as an opportunity to grow, rather than feeling negative towards yourself
3. When you hit a road block, tackle one small task at a time to gain your momentum back
```

## **More About Me:**

*I am a former ICU nurse who is changing careers to pursue my passion for coding. I am also a musician. I love how coding and music correlate. You take something that looks like a bunch of shapes on a page and bring it to life through music. The same process occurs with coding. You translate a language of text and symbols into something visual and unique. It's quite remarkable and I’m very excited to learn and grow in this field.
