# What is a Text Editor?
A text editor is software that allows you to create and edit text. Some important features to consider as a software developer when looking for a text editor are:
```
1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. theme options
4. extension selection
```
## Selecting a Text Editor
Your computer already comes with its own text editor, however, they typically contain the bare essentials. You may want to select another text editor for additional features like themes, syntax highlighting, and extensions. 

### Third-Party Text Editors
Below are a list of some third-party text editors. Each of these options has additional features from what you will find on your own computer's text editor. Some require a subscription. Some are compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux, while others are only compatible with one operating system. The theme and style of one editor may be more appealing to your workflow. It's best to do your research and test a few different editors to get a feel for what works best for you.

NotePad++
BB Edit
Visual Studio Code
Atom
Brackets
Sublime Text
```
## Text Editors vs. IDEs
While a text editor edits text and manages text and files, an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) can edit text, manage files, compile, and debug. It consolidates the different aspects of writing a computer program into one software. 

# What is a Terminal?
A terminal is a text-based interface that allows the user to enter commands. It then gives feedback through text. 

## Important Terminal Commands and Concepts

`pwd` Print Working Directory.
  Tells you where you are currently. 
  
 `ls` List.
  Tells you the contents of a directory. 
  
  `cd` Change Directions.
  Allows you to move to another directory. 
  
  `file` 
  Tells you information about the type of file. 
  
  `ls -a`
  Tells you all the contents of a directory, including hidden files. 
  
   `~` Tilde.
  This is a shortcut for your home directory.
  
  **Relative Path**:
    A pathway to a file location based on where we are currently in the system.
    
  **Absolute Path**: 
    A pathway to a file in relation to the root of the file. Not dependent on where we are in the system. 
    
  **Command History**:
    When you enter a command, it is stored in a history. You can find a previous command you entered by simply scrolling up in the terminal. 
    
  **Tab Completion**:
    As you are typing a path, hit the `Tab` key to initiate an auto-complete action. If nothing happens, hit `Tab` again to see all possible actions.
