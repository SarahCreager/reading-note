# CSS Layout

## CSS Basics
**Block level elements** begin on a new line

**Inline elements** are on the same line

**Normal Flow** default layout of page with each block level element beginning on the next line. 

**Relative Positioning** moves an element from its normal flow position. This doesn't affect any neighboring elements. 

**Float:** you can float elements to different parts of the webpage. Floated items need a width.

## Layout Grids
*Layout grids* use a grid to  help design the layout of pages and place items with consistency.

## CSS Framework
*CSS framework* provides structure for your CSS code. This framework is easier to use than writing CSS from scratch and has been tested across many browsers.
