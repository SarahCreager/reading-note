# What is JavaScript?
While HTML builds the foundation of a site and CSS adds stylistic components to it, JavaScript is a programming language that makes a website functional and dynamic.

### Static Website
This is what we created in the first few days of class. The website homepage looks the same for all users. 

### Dynamic Website
The homepage changes based on the user's actions. For example, my amazon homepage looks very different from yours based on my actions on the site.

# JavaScript Features
**JavaScript allows you to:**

* Store values inside variables.
* Run operations on text or *strings*. 
* Run code in response to an event that occurs on the webpage (updating what is seen on a site after a button is clicked).

## Running Order of JavaScript
When a browser runs JavaScript, it is typically run from top to bottom. The order of your code matters. You must define a variable before you can run functions with it. 

## Data Types of JavaScript
1). strings `"hello world"` or `'hello world'`

2). numbers `27`

3). booleans `true` or `false`

4). undefined

5). null

## Declaring a Variable
**Step 1: Declare the variable**

``` 
var firstName;
```
Right now, the variable is *undefined* because it has no value. 

**Step 2: Assign a value to the variable.**


```
firstName = "Sarah";
```
**Combine Step 1 and 2**

You can assign a value to a variable while you declare it.

```
var firstName = "Sarah";
```


# Other Important Concepts
``` 
= means assignment
````

```
== means comparison
 ```

 ```
// adds a comment to your code
 ```

 ```
the following can all be used to declare a variable:
 
 var
 let
 const
 ```
