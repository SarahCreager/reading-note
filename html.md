# What is Wireframe?
Wireframe is a simple rough draft of the format of a site, app, or product. It uses simple diagrams and text to create a visual guide for the framework of the site, with a focus on how the designer wants the user to process the content of the site. There are no colors or detailed design elements with wireframe.

## Wireframe Examples
* Wireframes can be drawn on paper or a whiteboard. 
* Wireframes can be created digitally with software.

## 3 Keys to Making Excellent Wireframes
1). **Clarity**:
  Needs to clearly explain purpose of site, what actions user can take, and meet the user's needs. 

2). **Confidence**:
  A clear call to action with easy navigation will boost the user's confidence and trust in your brand. 

3). **Simplicity**:
  Excessive information can be distracting. The goal is to help the user navigate the site and complete the call to action with as little confusion as possible. Too many details can deter from this. 

# HTML Basics
HTML is a markup language that defines the foundation and content of a web page. HTML uses elements which wrap content to create a desired outcome. Styling is not done in HTML.

## Structure of HTML

`<p>I love coding</p>`

**The opening tag**: `<p>` This is the name of the element (p for paragraph in this case). It is enclosed with *angle brackets*. This tells us where the element starts to take effect. 

**The closing tag**: `</p>` This has the same name as the opening tag but it has a *forward slash* before its name. This tells us where the element ends. 

**Content**: `I love coding` This is what's within the opening and closing tag.

**Element**: `<p>I love coding</p>` This is the combination of the opening tag, the closing tag, and the content within it. 

**Attribute**: ` class="editor-note"` This contains extra information about the element that you don't want to show up in the content. 

*Attributes have*:

`<p class="editor-note">I love coding</p>`

  * A space between the start of the attribute and the opening tag or previous attribute
  * The name followed by an equal sign =
  * The value wrapped by quotation marks

# Semantics
Semantics are the meaning or effect of a piece of code. Though you can render code that will look similar to code with a semantic value, it is best practice to use the correct element for the job. 

## Benefits of Using Semantics
* It will influence SEOs
* It can help visually impaired users
* It makes finding meaningful code easier
* It more clearly shows what type of data will populate
