# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to easily format the style of your writing on the GitHub platform. You can create lists, emphasize words with bold or italic lettering, add quotations, create tables, and more. Markdown uses regular text with a few symbols. 

# Some Examples of How to Use Markdown:

Below are a few examples of how to format your text and symbols in markdown. 

## *Example 1:* Change your Heading

You can change the heading of your font by using the # symbol

##### When you type:

```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```
##### It translates to:

## Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3



## *Example 2:* Create a List

You can easily create a list by adding a * before the list item name   

##### When you type:

```
* List item 1
* List item 2
* List item 3
```
##### It translates to:

*  List item 1
*  List item 2
*  List item 3


## *Example 3:* Attach a Link

You can attach an external link by placing brackets around the link title [ ] followed by the URL in parentheses ( )
