# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

## Transform

The `transform` property makes it possible to rotate, scale, move, or skew elements.

The transition property contains 3 values. 

1). the property being transitioned

2). the transition speed 

3). acceleration and deceleration calculation

## Animations

Our reading contained links to some really cool animation code. I  saved this to my chrome broswer to reference as needed. 

## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team


As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’ On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. ‘‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’’ Woolley said. ‘‘But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’’
Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ —

 But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.

 What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a ‘‘work face’’ when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations.
