## Revisions Lab Reflection
### 1. Navigating GitHub and VS Code
At first, I was slow at using GitHub. I didn't know what many of the buttons meant and I didn't have a clear workflow. After revising content, I got more and more comfortable with the process and began to anticipate how things would render on my site. Implementing A-C-P allowed me to work from VS Code and push my changes to my reading-notes repo on GitHub. This was confusing at first. I wasn't doing it correctly and I was pretty frustrated. But once I wrestled with it for a bit, I was able to figure out the process and I can appreciate how this will enhanced my workflow. 

### 2. Identifying Commits
This assignment forced me to write descriptive comments on my commits. I was not previously doing this. This will be key on projects with many revisions or when I am collaborating. There will be a clear paper trail of the revisions done and less confusion going forward. This is also beneficial if I need to revise an older version of a project without starting over entirely. 

### 3. Reviewing material
This assignment required me to revise and review my old notes. This helped refresh my memory on things I learned earlier in the course. We will continue to build quickly on these concepts in the next few weeks and having a firm foundation of understanding will be critical to my success at Code Fellows. 

## Final Words
Though this assignment was difficult at times, I now have a more thorough understanding of creating and organizing a site through Github, as well as integrating that workflow through VS Code using A-C-P.
